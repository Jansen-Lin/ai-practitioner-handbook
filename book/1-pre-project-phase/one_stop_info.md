# One-Stop Information

Usually, most real-world projects are scoped and agreed with a project sponsor in a presales setting. What happens next is that the AI consultant would hand over the project to AI engineer who may have sparse or no information about the project. This is a typical process that happens in many consulting firms. Presales consultants are securing projects with running an initial assessment of the use case, drafting the scope of the project and creating a proof-of-concept (POC). Their job ends when the deal is secured and handed over to the engineer in charge of project.

This is when the AI engineer may raise 101 questions in a panic mode:
1. what is the use case about?
2. what is the dataset available?
3. Does the sponsor have a certain requirement for deployment of the AI model?
4. And many other questions that follow ... 

Having many questions about the project may not be sufficient although more questions asked may lead to better clarity. But rather, it is pertinent that to be aware of a set of information/knowledge that an AI engineer must know as that provides an extensive and sufficient understanding about the project. Ultimately, you would want to ask yourself:
`What is the information/knowledge important for you to acquire as an AI engineer while taking over a project from a presales team?`

With reference to the CRISP-DM framework, it provides an insight into the lifecycle of a data science project. Yet, there are 2 important checkpoints highlighted within the frameworks - Business Understanding and Data Understanding. Besides that, it is crucial to understand how AI models could be applied in such business and data settings. 


1. Business Understanding 
Understanding business context and process is a great starting point as it allows you to understand the sponsor's long term goal and identify the problem statement that affects the sponsor's business or represents a pain point that the sponsor wants to solve. 

- Translation of Business Requirements to Technical Tasks

```
A critical skill in data science is the ability to decompose a data- analytics problem into pieces such that each piece matches a known task for which tools are available. Recognizing familiar problems and their solutions avoids wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel. It also allows people to focus attention on more interesting parts of the process that require human involvement—parts that have not been automated, so human creativity and intelligence must come in‐ to play.

2. Data Understanding

```
It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of the data because rarely is there an exact match with the problem. Historical data often are collected for purposes unrelated to the current business problem, or for no explicit purpose at all.
