## Introduction
Usually, most real-world projects are scoped and agreed with a project sponsor in a presales setting. What happens next is that the AI consultant would hand over the project to you, an AI engineer, who may have sparse or no information about the project. 

You may raise 101 questions in a panic mode. Having many questions about the project may not be sufficient. But rather, it is pertinent to be aware of a set of information/knowledge that an AI engineer must know as that provides an extensive and sufficient understanding about the project. Ultimately, you want to ask yourself:


```What is the information/knowledge important for you to acquire as an AI engineer while taking over a project from a presales team?```

Specifically, there are essential information you want to acquire - business understanding, data understanding and algorithm understanding.
